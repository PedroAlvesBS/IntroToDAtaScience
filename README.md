# IntroToDataScience

The content of this repo were developed in a subject called "Python to DataScience" Ministered by [MSc. Rosana √Åurea Tonetti Massahud](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7365724131999035) at CEFET-MG.

### 1st Work - # Alcohol Effects on Study analysis

This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).

### 2nd Work - # Service Orders for Maintenance

Data extracted from a base of Service Orders for Maintenance of its own fleet, in maintenance management spreadsheets of a fictitious environmental services company Bonis Ambiental. The data can be found at: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bonisvc/ordem-de-servico-da-manutencao)

### 3rd Work - # Average car prices - Brazil

The variables fuel, gear and engine_size were extracted from values of column model, as in original there is no column dedicated to those values. Since some values for model don't contain the information of engine size, this dataset doesn't contain the whole data from FIPE's original. Additionally, if 'Aut.' is not present in model, the car is assumed to be manual.

The prices are calculated by FIPE and they're here as original (in BRL).

FIPE updates the information on a monthly basis. Here, the referred month is given as mothofreference, as the corresponding year has variable named as yearofreference

The FIPE codes (fipe_codes) are the model identifier used in FIPE webpage. It can be found at: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vagnerbessa/average-car-prices-bazil)
